# Resin Timer for Genshin Impact 

This web application allows players to schedule their gametime on Genshin Impact in advance as the game is centered around the Resin system. This application will allow you to know when your resin is fully replenished and when it reaches a particular milestone amount. I created this because I got annoyed in having to manually calculate and figuring out the precise time for a certain resin amount to be regenerated :P
